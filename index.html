  <p>I used to believe that we were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful. But now I'm starvin' for your touch, haunted by the ghosts of your love. I miss the way you undress, I miss your head on my chest. Can't stop this feelin' anymore, I've forgotten what I started fightin' for.

It's time to let you go, go out and start again. But it's not that easy, baby, let me show you love. I'll give you love, oh. I'll give you love, love, love. Let me love you.

You're lookin' for someone with a wicked vibe, don't deny. That love ain't simple, why can't you just let me love you? I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough. I'm givin' you all my love, I'm still lookin' up.

Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah. I won't give up, nah, nah, nah. Let me love you. Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah. I won't give up, nah, nah, nah. Let me love you.
